This is a small library of utility classes for working with the [Sesame](http://openrdf.org) 1.2.x API.  

For working with Sesame/OpenRdf 2.x, much of the functionality included here is either part of their core API, or included in the [OpenRdf utils](http://github.com/clarkparsia/cp-openrdf-utils) library.
